These are the data structures that I used.

1. PriorityQueue.java

In this I implemented the priority queue using a doubly linked list. I did this because it was easy to insert, remove and access the elements 
that had the lowest and highest priority and it was efficient as well, with most of them having a Big O of O(1)/O(N).

Did not use any built in classes.

2. SymbolTable.java

In this I implmented the pair with a Hash Map. The addresses and their symbol records, or the addresses and their stack distances pair acted as a 
key value pair. 

used java.util.HashMap

3. Sequence.java

In this I implemented the sequence with a Red and Black tree. This is was implemented using Tree Set class. It stored all the time and the cache elmenets
as a tree.

used java.util.TreeSet
